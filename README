#Davia.com Interview Test

## Instructions

Please create a inventory importer that will take a csv file of products and create/update the items as necessary. 
Access to do the update needs to occur through both a admin web interface and a rake task.
The admin web interface need not be styled or look good (just functional).

## CSV

The items csv can be found in the /db directory of the rails app.

## Ambiguity

When dealing with ambiguity make your best guess at what an e-commerce site would need and execute according to 
your insights. The job requires you to be more than just a simple coder but an intellectual that can problem
solve and own his/her features.

## Common Issues

There are a number of issues that occur with product importers including:
 
 * Duplication control
 * User errors (blank fields, prices that have typos, copy paste errors)
 * Slow speeds when images are involved.

## Quality
 
Treat this project as a real production project complete with :
 * tests you normally write
 * appropriate git comments and commits
 * documentation when code is rather tricky (don't over document though)
 * dependability in product (no excuses for why something doesn't work)
 * general good understandable code 

## Speed

The faster you can do it without sacrificing anything in code quality is a bonus!

## Editor settings

We use 2 spaces (as spaces) for our tabs.


## Contact

When you are finished send a email to jobs@davia.com with the url where we can test the web interface
and another url to your fork with your code updates so we can review your code.

If you have any questions you can't solve on your own or general questions about the project you can also use 
jobs@davia.com to get a quick answer.
